<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This responbility is consisted of some thought, notices and some codes when i read about < Oranges >. all the codes are checked one by one and try to make sure that ecah codes is running correctlly in <em> Linux Plantform</em> :).</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 11 folders in it.</br>
the chap1 is about a simple and basic boots code. using .asm.</br>
the chap3 is about protect modle on X86 plantform. using .asm</br>
the chap4 is about advanced protect modle on X86 plantform. using .asm</br>
the chap5 is about a oroginal kernel, using .asm and .c</br>
the chap6 is about process in a kernel</br>
the chap7 is about I/O system in a kernel</br>
the chap8 is about IPC ( internal process communication ) in a kernel</br>
the chap9 is about FS ( file system ) in a kernel</br>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run those codes, you need install some tools:</br>
<strong>bochs</strong> -- is an simulator of X86 plantform. the lasted version is 2.4.6, you can install it by ` sudo apt-get install bochs bochs-x bximage vgabios` or by sources ( you can use this method to install a version without debug, to install a debug version, you should install it by source, it's reall complicated, <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/u011889952/article/details/45397355">reference here</a> )</br>
<strong>qemu</strong> -- is another simulator of X86 plantform. you just need to choose one of them to simulate your kernel.</br>
<strong>xxd</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
<strong>readelf</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
<strong>objdump</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
