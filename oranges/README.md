the chap5 is about a oroginal kernel, using .asm and .c</br>
the chap6 is about process in a kernel</br>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run those codes, you need install some tools:</br>
<strong>bochs</strong> -- is an simulator of X86 plantform. the lasted version is 2.4.6, you can install it by ` sodo apt-get install bochs bochs-x bximage vgabios` or by sources ( it is too difficult for me to install it, some bugs can't be fixed)</br>
<strong>qemu</strong> -- is another simulator of X86 plantform. you just need to choose one of them to simulate your kernel.</br>
<strong>xxd</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
<strong>readelf</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
<strong>objdump</strong> -- is a tool for analysising memory and file system used in our proj.</br>
